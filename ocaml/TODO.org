* Things [0/4]

- [ ] At the same time, support prod mode, where we have a pre-built
  javascript executable
  - write a shell-script to build and put the artifacts in the right
    place
  - Have some support in Racket for running both ways
- [ ] Write a README for the game, hopefully mapping out the API.
- [ ] Write more tutorials (like how to write a PID controller)
- [ ] Write some code to auto-install packages, maybe?
- [ ] Try it out on a user! See if we can get Siggy and Nava up and
  running with it.
- [ ] Support production builds (no sourcemap, so no
  main.runtime.bc.js)
