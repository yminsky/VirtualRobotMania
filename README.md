### How to start making the robot do stuff!
- Firstly, make sure you know the basics of Racket. We have a very
  basic tutorial [here](cheatsheat/RACKET-CHEATSHEAT.html). Also,
  [this one](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/racket/) covers a bunch
  more stuff, but more briefly.
- You can write stuff in the body of the "on-tick" function. On-tick
  is called every tick, and can be thought almost of as the "master
  function"
- Also you can edit the call to "make-robot" to customize the look (or
  sometimes functionality) of your robot
